# Yu-Gi-Oh! Card Fusion Simulator

## Overview

In the card game "Yu-Gi-Oh!", players can combine cards to create new cards with enhanced abilities. These combinations, known as "fusions," can involve different types of cards, such as monsters, spells, and equipment.

The goal of this project is to implement a program that simulates all these card fusions using operator overloading for the `+` operator as a friend function.

## Project Details

The program simulates the fusion of Yu-Gi-Oh! cards by overloading the `+` operator. This allows combining different types of cards to create new cards. The fusion process will be implemented using the `+` operator as a friend function, ensuring that the merging of cards works seamlessly.

### Features

- **Card Types**: The program will support multiple types of cards, including:
  - **Monster Cards**
  - **Spell Cards**
  - **Equipment Cards**

- **Fusion Process**: The program will simulate the fusion of these cards into a new card with enhanced abilities.

- **Operator Overloading**: The fusion process will be implemented using the overloaded `+` operator as a friend function.

## Requirements

To run the program, the following are required:

- A C++ compiler (such as g++ or clang++).
- A basic understanding of C++ syntax, classes, operator overloading, and friend functions.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Compile the source code using your C++ compiler.
3. Run the executable to simulate the fusion of cards in the game.
