# Exercises - Object-Oriented Programming

## Exercise 1: Animal Hierarchy

**Description:**  
Implement a class hierarchy to represent animals. Create a base class called `Animal` with a virtual method `emitSound()`. Derive classes `Dog`, `Cat`, and `Cow`, each implementing the `emitSound()` method appropriately. Create an array of pointers to `Animal` and add instances of the derived classes. Loop through the array, calling `emitSound()` for each animal.

## Exercise 2: Payment System

**Description:**  
Implement a payment system using inheritance and polymorphism. Create a base class called `Employee` with virtual methods to calculate the monthly salary and print employee details. Derive classes `SalariedEmployee` and `HourlyEmployee`. Create an array of pointers to `Employee` and add instances of the derived classes. Loop through the array, calling the appropriate methods for each employee.

## Exercise 3: Geometric Shapes

**Description:**  
Implement a class hierarchy to represent geometric shapes. Create a base class called `Shape` with a virtual method `area()`. Derive classes `Circle`, `Rectangle`, and `Triangle`, each implementing the `area()` method appropriately. Create an array of pointers to `Shape` and add instances of the derived classes. Loop through the array, calling `area()` for each shape.

## Exercise 4: Media Library

**Description:**  
Implement a class hierarchy to represent media types. Create a base class called `Media` with virtual methods `displayInfo()` and `play()`. Derive classes `Book`, `CD`, and `DVD`, each implementing the methods appropriately. Create an array of pointers to `Media` and add instances of the derived classes. Loop through the array, calling the appropriate methods for each media type.

## Exercise 5: Transportation System

**Description:**  
Implement a class hierarchy to represent modes of transportation. Create a base class called `Transportation` with virtual methods `start()` and `stop()`. Derive classes `Car`, `Bicycle`, and `Airplane`, each implementing the methods appropriately. Create an array of pointers to `Transportation` and add instances of the derived classes. Loop through the array, calling the appropriate methods for each mode of transportation.
