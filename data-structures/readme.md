# Data Structures 1
> Understanding and implementing efficient data structures using the C programming language  

## Overview  
This repository contains all the material, exercises, and projects developed during the **Data Structures** course as part of my Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science at UFMT. The focus of this course is to analyze, select, and implement various data structures to solve computational problems effectively.  

## Course Objectives  
- Understand and implement basic and advanced data structures in **C**.  
- Analyze and compare algorithm complexities.  
- Apply data structures to solve real-world problems.  
- Develop a strong foundation in memory representation and manipulation.  

## Topics Covered  
1. **Review of C Programming**:  
   - Arrays, matrices, records, and pointers.  

2. **Linear Data Structures**:  
   - Static lists, linked lists, doubly linked lists, circular lists.  

3. **Stacks and Queues**:  
   - Implementation and applications.  

4. **Sorting Algorithms**:  
   - Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Shell Sort, Counting Sort, Quick Sort.  

5. **Algorithm Complexity**:  
   - Introduction to algorithm analysis and complexity evaluation.  

6. **Heap**:  
   - Heap data structure and Heap Sort algorithm.  

7. **Trees**:  
   - Binary trees and n-ary trees (multiple children).  

8. **File Manipulation**:  
   - Basic operations for handling external storage.
