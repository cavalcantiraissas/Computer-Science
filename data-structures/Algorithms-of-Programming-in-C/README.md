# Solved Exercises - "Algorithms of Programming in C"

This repository contains solutions to the exercises proposed in the book **"Algorithms of Programming in C"** by Silvio do Lago Pereira. The goal is to consolidate the understanding of fundamental programming concepts using the C programming language.

## Structure

The exercises are organized by chapters and topics, with each solution provided in C code. These solutions serve as practice to enhance programming skills and understanding of algorithms, data structures, and problem-solving techniques in C.

## Objectives

- Strengthen knowledge of algorithm design and implementation in C.
- Practice key programming concepts such as loops, conditionals, arrays, and functions.
- Build proficiency in debugging and optimizing C code.
  
## Getting Started

To view or use the solutions:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the folder for each chapter to find specific exercise solutions.
3. Compile and run the C programs using a C compiler (e.g., GCC).
