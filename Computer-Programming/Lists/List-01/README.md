# Programming Exercises - List 01  
> A series of basic algorithms to practice computational logic and Python programming  

## Overview  
This folder contains a collection of algorithms designed to develop problem-solving skills and reinforce programming concepts. The exercises cover fundamental topics such as conditional statements, loops, and basic mathematical operations.  

## Algorithms  

### **1. Read and Print Integers**  
- **Description**: Receive two integers from the user and display the values.  

### **2. Multiplication of Two Integers**  
- **Description**: Receive two integers, multiply them, and display the result.  

### **3. Successor and Predecessor**  
- **Description**: Receive an integer and display its successor and predecessor.  

### **4. Real Number Operations**  
- **Description**: Receive a real number and display:  
  - The number itself  
  - Its square  
  - Its square root  

### **5. Greater than 20**  
- **Description**: Receive an integer and display it only if it is greater than 20.  

### **6. Square Root or Square**  
- **Description**: Receive a real number:  
  - If the number is zero or positive, display its square root.  
  - If the number is negative, display its square.  

### **7. Color Classification**  
- **Description**: Receive an integer and classify it as:  
  - `"White"` if less than 0  
  - `"Green"` if between 0 and 100  
  - `"Blue"` if between 101 and 1000  
  - `"Red"` if greater than 1000  

### **8. Even or Odd**  
- **Description**: Receive an integer and determine whether it is even or odd.  

### **9. Divisibility Check**  
- **Description**: Receive an integer and check if it is divisible by 2, 3, 5, and 10. Display the results.  

### **10. Maximum and Minimum of Two Integers**  
- **Description**: Receive two integers and identify the larger and smaller numbers. Display both.  

### **11. Maximum and Minimum of Three Integers**  
- **Description**: Receive three integers and identify the largest and smallest values.  

### **12. Middle Value**  
- **Description**: Receive three distinct integers and identify the middle value (the one between the smallest and largest).  

### **13. Double and Compare**  
- **Description**: Receive two integers, identify the larger value, double the smaller one, and check if the doubled value exceeds the original larger value. Display the result.  

### **14. Academic Performance Advice**  
- **Description**: Receive the first grades of three subjects from a student, calculate the average, and provide feedback:  
  - If the average is less than 5, suggest dropping the subject with the lowest grade.  
  - If the average is between 5 and 7, advise focusing on improving the lowest grade.  

## How to Use  
1. Clone this repository or download the files.  
2. Open each algorithm in Python-compatible IDE or text editor.  
3. Run the programs, input the required values, and analyze the outputs.
