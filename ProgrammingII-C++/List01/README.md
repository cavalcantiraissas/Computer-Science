# Exercise List 01 - Programming II

## Overview
This directory contains solutions to **List 01** exercises for the **Programming II** course at the Federal University of Mato Grosso (UFMT). The exercises aim to reinforce the use of **control structures**, **input/output operations**, and **functions** in **C++**.

## Topics Covered
- **Control Structures**: Repetition (`for`, `while`) and decision-making (`if`).
- **Arithmetic Operations**: Sum, average, squares, and factorial calculations.
- **Input/Output Operations**: Using `cin` and `cout` to interact with the user.

## Exercises
1. **Sum and Arithmetic Mean**  
   Write a program that reads **N** numbers from the keyboard and displays their total sum and arithmetic mean.

2. **Sum of N Even Numbers**  
   Write a program that calculates and displays the sum of the first **N** even numbers.

3. **Squares of Numbers**  
   Write a program that prints the first **N** squared numbers.  
   Example: For **N = 5**, the output should be: `1, 4, 9, 16, 25`.

4. **Factorial Calculation**  
   Write a program that calculates the factorial of a positive integer provided by the user.

## How to Run the Programs
1. Ensure you have a working C++ compiler, such as `g++`.
2. Compile a program using the command:
   ```bash
   g++ -o output_name exercise_name.cpp
