# List 03 Algorithms

This repository contains a set of algorithms designed to manipulate vectors (arrays) in various ways. The following algorithms are implemented:

## Algorithm 1: Fill a vector of 5 positions with values from 1 to 5.
This algorithm creates an array with 5 positions, filled with values starting from 1 up to 5.

## Algorithm 2: Fill a vector of 5 positions with values from 5 to 1.
Similar to the previous one, this algorithm creates an array with 5 positions, but this time the values are filled in reverse order, from 5 down to 1.

## Algorithm 3: Read 10 values from the user, store them in a vector, and replace each value with its double.
The algorithm reads 10 numbers from the user and stores them in a vector. Each element is then replaced by its double, and the updated vector is displayed.

## Algorithm 4: Read 5 values for the first vector and store their double in the second vector. Display both vectors at the end.
This algorithm takes 5 values from the user, stores them in the first vector, and then stores the double of each value in the second vector. Both vectors are displayed after processing.

## Algorithm 5: Read 5 values for the first vector and store them in reverse order in the second vector.
The user provides 5 values, and these values are stored in reverse order in the second vector.

## Algorithm 6: Read 10 values, identify, and display the largest and smallest values of the vector.
The algorithm reads 10 values from the user and identifies the largest and smallest values in the vector, displaying the results.

## Algorithm 7: Read a value for the first position of a vector of 10 and fill subsequent positions with the double of the previous value.
The algorithm fills a vector of 10 positions by doubling the previous value for each subsequent position.

## Algorithm 8: Read two initial values and fill the rest of the vector with the sum of the two previous values, forming a sequence similar to Fibonacci.
This algorithm uses the Fibonacci sequence concept, where each number is the sum of the previous two values.

## Algorithm 9: Read a reference value and fill the vector from the ends to the center, incrementing the value by 1 in each position, creating a symmetrical sequence.
This algorithm fills the vector from the two ends toward the center, incrementing the value in each position and forming a symmetrical pattern.

## Algorithm 10: Read a reference value, store it in the center of the vector, and then fill the positions from the inside out, forming a symmetrical sequence.
The reference value is placed at the center of the vector, and values are incremented outward symmetrically.

## Algorithm 11: Fill a vector of 10 positions with values from 1 to 10, alternating between the ends to create an intercalated sequence.
This algorithm alternates between the two ends of the vector, filling it with values from 1 to 10.

## Algorithm 12: Read 10 values for the first vector, calculate the averages of pairs of specific positions, and store the results in a second vector of 5 positions.
This algorithm takes 10 values from the user, calculates the average of specific pairs of positions, and stores the results in a second vector of 5 positions.
