# List 02

## Algorithm 1
Count from 0 to 5 and display these values on the screen.

## Algorithm 2
Perform a countdown, displaying values from 10 to 1.

## Algorithm 3
Read a positive integer and print from 0 to the given value.

## Algorithm 4
Read a positive integer and display the count sequence from zero to the value and back to zero.

## Algorithm 5
Read two integers, "limit" and "increment", and display values from 0 to the limit, with steps defined by the increment.

## Algorithm 6
Calculate the multiplication between two positive integers using successive addition.

## Algorithm 7
Read a number and display its multiplication table from 1 to 10.

## Algorithm 8
Ask for the number of values to be entered, calculate the average of the provided values, and display the result.

## Algorithm 9
Compare the sum of three values with a reference value provided and perform a count based on the largest value between the sum and the reference.

## Algorithm 10
Count up to a given value, displaying double the odd values and half the even values.
